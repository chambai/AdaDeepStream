Dnn								# The name of the deep neural network
DatasetName                         # Dataset name
DataClasses			#intarray    # An integer array of classes that the DNN is trained on
ActivationTrainingBatchSize		#int			# Integer defining the number of training instances that activation data will be extracted for in one batch (this is required due to python/spyder memory limitations)
LayerActivationReduction    #stringarray		# Data reduction techniques that are perfomed on each layer.  Element 1 will be performed across all layers, then technique 2 etc...  Allowed names are flatten, maxpooling1d (PoolingOutputSize is required), jsdiverge, jsdist, chjsdiverge, chjsdist, pad (PadLength is required).
PadLength           #int                # output size after pooling (1D). Used if ActivationPooling is set
AnalysisModule					# The name of the streaming analysis module
NumUnseenInstances			#int			# Integer defining the total number of unseen instances to be processed individually. This is used in conjunction with DataDiscrepancy and DataDiscrepancyFrequency to provide the specified frequency of data discrepancies defined there
DataDiscrepancy				#CE,CD,outlier	# The type of data discrepancy to be introduced to the unseen instances.  If set to 'none', DataDiscrepancyFrequency will be ignored
DataDiscrepancyClass	#intarray # The class numbers of the data discrepancies, or 'all' if a specific class is not required
StreamBatchLength			#int			# Number of unseen instances to process in one batch
DriftType                       # DriftType
DriftPattern                    # DriftPattern
Tune			#bool		# repeats the test until it has performed all of its tuning
SimulateDriftDetection	#bool		# if True, drift detection will be simulated such that the drift detection is perfect.
AdaptationTimeDelay	#int		# The amount of time is seconds that each window is delayed during adaptation
DnnTrainEpochs			#int			# Number of epochs to train the DNN on
DeepStreamModelName                 # the name of the deep stream model
